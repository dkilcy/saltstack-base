3. Post-Install Setup

#### Setup the Salt master

1. Install the Salt master on all workstation (utility) nodes.

 ```bash
 yum install salt-master
 ```

2. Verify the installation

 ```bash
 [root@workstation2 ~]# salt --version
 salt 2015.5.0 (Lithium)
 [root@workstation2 ~]# 
 ```

3. Create the /etc/salt/master.d file to hold configuration files

 ```bash
 mkdir -p /etc/salt/master.d
 ```

4. Star the Salt master

 ```bash
 systemctl start salt-master.service
 systemctl enable salt-master.service
 ```
 
 #### Setup the Salt minion

 ```bash
 yum install salt-minion
 ```

6. Verify the installation

 ```bash
 [root@workstation2 ~]# salt-call --version
 salt-call 2015.5.0 (Lithium)
 [root@workstation2 ~]# 
 ```

7. Set the minion ID as the short hostname

 ```bash
 hostname -s > /etc/salt/minion_id
 ```

8. Start the Salt minion 

 ```bash
 systemctl start salt-minion.service
 systemctl enable salt-minion.service
 ```

9. Add the local minion to the master.

 ```bash
 [root@workstation2 ~]# salt-key -L

 ```bash
 [root@workstation2 ~]# salt-key -A 
 The following keys are going to be accepted:
 Unaccepted Keys:
